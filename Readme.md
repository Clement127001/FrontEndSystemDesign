# Front End System Design: A Journey of Optimization

## Introduction

Front end system design may seem like a hidden realm compared to the flashy world of user interfaces, but it's the backbone that ensures smooth communication with the backend. Picture a conversation between a client and a server, where every word counts. Now, imagine being able to skip unnecessary dialogues and jump straight to the point. That's the power of leveraging caching techniques at various levels to streamline the user experience.
